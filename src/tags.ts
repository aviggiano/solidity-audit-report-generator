  'FEE_ON_TRANSFER': "Fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens are not properly handled by the protocol. Some ERC20 tokens take a fee when tokens are transferred them (for example PAXG), and others do not currently take fees but may do so in the future (for example USDT, which has built-in fee support, or USDC, which is an upgradeable contract). The current implementation of the reviewed protocol will not work if such tokens are used, as the amount received may be less than the amount specified in the transfer. @recommendation Properly handle fee-on-transfer tokens and rebasing tokens. For example, calculate the amount before/after the transfer and update the accounting mechanism accordingly. Alternatively, document to users that these types of tokens are not supported by the protocol.",
  'DOS_USDC_BLOCKLIST': "@title Blocklisted accounts can DoS the withdrawal system. @description Currently, transfers are queued in an array and processed sequentially in a for loop. However, some ERC-20 tokens implement blocklists, such as USDC. If a `safeTransfer` is performed to a blocklisted address, the transfer will revert and the withdrawl process will brick. @recommendation Implement 2-step withdrawals: 1. In a for loop, increase the user's amount that can be safely withdrawn. 2. The user themselves withdraw their balance"
